# libfwt

## WTF is libfwt?

FWT is a sweet (IMVHO) abbreviation for framework. It is basically a set of classes
and functions which I use in most of my projects.

TODO: write more detailed description.

## Compilation

libfwt requires C++11 support.

To compile simply run make. If you want to cross-compile for mingw32,
simply override MINGW\_PREFIX in Makefile.local with proper prefix.
