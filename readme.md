# libfwt

## WTF is libfwt?

FWT is a sweet (IMVHO) abbreviation for framework. It is basically a set of classes
and functions which I use in most of my projects.

TODO: write more detailed description.

## Features

Supported platforms: linux, windows (using mingw), browser (using emscripten)
TODO: write me

## Compilation

libfwt requires C++14 support.

To compile simply run make. If you want to cross-compile for mingw32,
simply override MINGW\_PREFIX in Makefile.local with proper prefix.
There is also an option to compile for the web (using emscripten).
