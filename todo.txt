- Fix copyrights
- make AnimaedMesh similar to AnimatedModel
- add class VertexArraySpec and use it to verify drawcalls
- saving/loading Mesh colors to XML
- Separate model matrix from view matrix in MatrixStack?
- MemorySaver should increase it's size if necessary
- show rare profiles at the end
- add StrongBaseType<> class
- additional isnan checks?
- keyChar is not treated as key event in InputEvent::isKeyEvent
- add clang's small vector
- std::move -> move
- think about usefulness of const correctness; in some cases were just wasting time
- separate align function for fonts
- enumNext, enumPrev, enumShift?
- add precompiled headers
- DEFINE_ENUM in class scope
- Hide HAlign, VAlign inside fontstyle?
- Color -> FColor (float4), IColor (dword)

- more todos in the code
- texture should use int2 instead of width, height
- Saver, Loader -> SaveStream, LoadStream or similar
- automatic operators: > >= <=
- colors in Color:: shouldn't be defined in cpp file coz they can't be used in static definitions
- normalize -> normalized

- __attribute__((cold)) on throwException (all code that leads to it
  should be inside cold section)
- Separate ASSERTS which throw (asserts that validate input) from ASSERTS which doesn't (verifying program correctness)
- Add asserts ASSERT_NE _LT, etc.
- clamp doesn't work properly when max < min

- consider using Niebler's ranges

- Fix satTest (when edges from two objects are the same, you will get 0 normals)

- VSYNC under windows
- Fix problem in Cache when get_immutable_ptr() return null
- input key tab doesnt work
- use A-buffer for rendering transparent objects (will be useful for SSAO as well)

- Optimize kerning loop in font_factory.cpp
- Fix TODO in filesystem_linux (regarding links).
- In fact, just fix all TODOs
- Think about moving globla functions to classes / namespaces (especially functions in fwk_profile.h)
- Fix the namespace mess
- Bug: keyDown(InputKey::tab) doesn't work
- scanf's are very slow compared to strto*, maybe we should change printfs as well in text printer?

- Add HTML5 build target for pre-commit tests

- ModelNodes should be more flexible when creating (no need for empty root node, nodes with empty names should be ok, etc.)

- when printing strings to XML, library should check if restricted characters are not used by accident (&, <, >)
- separate XMLFormatter from TextFormatter

- Fix texture loaders so that they wont have to be inlined in texture.cpp
- Add tests for SimpleMesh operations

- Clang 3.6 Crashes when compiling frustum.cpp with -O2/-O3 and DNDEBUG


- tools/model_viewer crashes when wrong path is passed (for example folder instead of path to .model file)

- When LLDB is attached, make it catch all throws automatically

- Think about accuracy of different math functions. Some of tem could be easily improved

- Serialization of floats to XML isn't accurate; fix it
